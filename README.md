# SimplMind
*A very very simple Feedforward Neural Network library in Java*

SimplMind was developed as way for me to further my understanding of Neural Network and as a result is not optimised in any way shape or form. If you do decide you want to used this library, enjoy.

## Features
- Vectorized - uses a matrix implementation to process training data
- Configurable - allows you to customize the network topology

## Creating a Mind
To create a mind you must first decide on its topology, this is done by creating input, hidden and output layers.
